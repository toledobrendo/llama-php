Luxanna Crownguard hails from Demacia, an insular realm where magical abilities are viewed with fear and 
suspicion. Able to bend light to her will, she grew up dreading discovery and exile, and was forced to 
keep her power secret, in order to preserve her family's noble status. Nonetheless, Lux's optimism and 
resilience have led her to embrace her unique talents, and she now covertly wields them in service of her 
homeland.

PASSIVE
ILLUMINATION
Lux's damaging spells charge the target with energy for 6 seconds. Lux's next attack ignites the energy, 
dealing bonus magic damage (depending on Lux's level) to the target.

Q
LIGHT BINDING
Lux releases a sphere of light that binds and deals damage to up to two enemy units.

W
PRISMATIC BARRIER
Lux throws her wand and bends the light around any friendly target it touches, protecting them from enemy 
damage.

E
LUCENT SINGULARITY
Fires an anomaly of twisted light to an area, which slows nearby enemies. Lux can detonate it to damage 
enemies in the area of effect.

R
FINAL SPARK
After gathering energy, Lux fires a beam of light that deals damage to all targets in the area. In 
addition, triggers Lux's passive ability and refreshes the Illumination debuff duration.
